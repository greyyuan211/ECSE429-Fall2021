> **Roles and responsibilities of the quality assurance team members.** This section contains a general outline of the project timeline for creating the test plan, managing team workflow, and working on the project. 

### Timeline of Events
* **November 1 - November 2**: exploratory testing of the PetClinic application. Got together as a group, ran the application, and tested the front-end behaviour, as well as back-end API calls with Postman.
* **November 3 - November 4**: designed and finalized a test plan. Used Google Docs to write out all the classes and associated methods-to-test for each test level (unit, integration, API, acceptance, non-functional). 
* **November 5**: assigned responsibilities. Every team member got an almost equal amount of tests to do for unit, integration, API, and acceptance tests. It was important that all team members got a chance to work on as many different test levels as possible so that everyone could benefit learning from the project.
* **November 6**: created test stubs in classes and used GitHub issues to assign tasks. GitHub actions were integrated.
* **November 7-12**: everyone worked on their assigned tasks. Branches were used for each test class and pull requests were created for code reviews. 
* **November 13-14**: merging of branch code and code coverage analysis. Non-functional performance tests were written and wiki created.
